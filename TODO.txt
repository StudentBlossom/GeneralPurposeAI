With the biggest improvement being the "thinking" 
which goes like this
>first test out every move to see which variables change
>if possible bind outputs (which action) to input (variables)
>when successfull remember what the variables were
>increase chance of the actions that affect those variables in the way brings it closer

for example if it has the option to move up and down (that is the output) and it gets its own y coordinate and the goal y coordinate
It will first stand still a bit, it remembers what changes. those variables cannot be confindetally influenced
then moves up, sees what changes, then moves down, and it remembers which choice makes the number go up and which one goes down

then after a few times it will see that the
